# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a regression analysis to predict bike sharing demand. The analysis is based on a dataset containing historical information about bike rentals.


## Overview
Bike sharing systems are an innovative way of urban transportation. This project focuses on predicting the number of bikes rented in a given period based on various input features such as weather conditions, season, and time of the day.

The project employs a machine learning regression model to analyze the data and provide accurate predictions.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling, etc.)
- Feature engineering
- Regression model training and evaluation
- Visualization of results

## Conclusion
Bike demand is influenced is by features like season , year , weather situation affects count of total rental bikes including both casual and registered

Features such as season and year is strongly positive co-related beacuse when season and year increases count of total rental bikes including both casual and registered also increases


Features such as weather situation is strongly negative co-related because when the weather situation increases count of total rental bikes including both casual and registered
